1. Create 2 ec2 instances –  (same security group)

2. Open ports between them – make sure instances can communicate to each other. Use the default security group which has one rule relevant for this case:
        Type: All Traffic
        Source: Custom – id of the security group

3. Log in to the instance you want to connect from to the other instance
    	
4. Generate RSA public and private key.
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -N "" -f /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa
  Private key will be generated in id_rsa and public key in id_rsa.pub

5. Copy your private AWS key to ~/.ssh/my.key
    cp /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/my.key
    	
6. Make that file only usable by the owner:
    chmod 600 .ssh/my.key
	
8. Add the public key to the authorized keys in the other instance:
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -i ~/.ssh/my.key ubuntu@***.**.**.** "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

9. You can now ssh into the other instance without a password:
ssh ***.**.**.**
